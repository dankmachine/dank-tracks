babby's first sample?


* charlie biddle/oliver jones - all the things you are (4:12 - 4:25); see if this repeats anywhere else
                              (wow this has been sampled a lot... also around 5:54 till the end)
                              - maybe try another one from these guys?

* joao donato - samba de orfeu (2:40 to 2:46 / ending loop in general)
    - rip, apparently beaten to the punch by j dilla in "to the zz zz ah you
      don't stop"
    - on the other hand, that's probably a sign of good taste and the dilla
      beat is only 24 seconds
